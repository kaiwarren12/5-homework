# Word Day Scheduler

## Description

A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. I created this by using Jquery and moment.js to make the scheduler interactive by setting the past scheduled events to the color grey, current event red, and upcoming events later in the day are shown in green.
I also used moment.js to create a current date at the top within the jumbotron that automatically updates.
