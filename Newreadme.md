In this homework I created a work day scheduler. I created this by using Jquery and moment.js to make the scheduler interactive by setting the past scheduled events to the color grey, current event red, and upcoming events later in the day are shown in green. 

I also used moment.js to create a current date at the top within the jumbotron that automatically updates.
